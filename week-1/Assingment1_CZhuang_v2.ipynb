This notebook outlines scraping text from the web, from images, PDF and Word documents. Then we detail \"spidering\" or walking through hyperlinks to build samples of online content, and using APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, provided by webservices to access their content. Along the way, we will use regular expressions, outlined in the reading, to remove unwanted formatting and ornamentation. Finally, we discuss various text encodings, filtering and data structures in which text can be placed for analysis.\n",
