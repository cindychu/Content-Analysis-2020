Um I guess I'd like to hear you talk about it I actually didn't look much into the legal system here, but for death penalty, I think like, if..I think if someone committed to a really serious crime such as umm very like, like murdering people and like not being regretful about that and then um like continuously doing a lot of things that will harm the security of the society and also the people around them. I don't think there is any reason why this person could continue to live in this society, Yeah, like definitely, like, I definitely see what you mean what the reason I personally am against the death penalty isn't because I don't think some people should be from removed society because if you have like someone who's like, I don't know, like a terrorist who, who knows people indiscriminately or something like that, you know, I think they should be removed from society, but at the same time, you know, in terms of like implementation a lot of the time. So like, in the US, like, when someone is sentenced to death, like, the, just from, like, there's, I guess there's two perspectives, there's like, the sort of pragmatic perspective and then there's, like a moral perspective, like, and just from, like, the pragmatic perspective, you know, like when you're talking about like, like, I've done a little bit of research into this. Uh like, it actually costs more to send it to like, uhh an execution because there's a ton of like checks to make sure that you're not executing the wrong person like even even in spite of that every once in a while, you know, like people after their execution are exonerated by DNA evidence and you know, you can't undo a death sentence but you can undo a Life Sentence  I see what you mean.  And then the other thing is like from like a more like moral perspective or not not even a moral perspective. But like, I remember I, I haven't actually read this study. But I remember reading that there was a study that said that like the death penalty isn't any worse than like a life sentence, like life without parole when it comes to punishing or when it comes to discouraging crime. And like when it comes to um what is it? And then like some people, like, from certain points of view, you know, a life sentence without parole might even be a worse punishment than a death sentence. Because with the death sentence, you know, you're you're dying, like you don't have to stew in prison and think about what you've done, you know? With the life sentence, you know, you're left to live the rest of your life, you know, thinking about what you did if that makes sense?  But I guess that, um I don't know.

6,NB,"Yea, so so so. What do you--what do you personally think about this? I think that the US, I answered that the US should lower it. Um not too strongly but just moderately I agree with the statement is because um..I'm so I'm from Korea and the drinking age in Korea is 19. And so I was.. I guess I was shocked when I came to the US. I thought it was 21.  OK-- And I-I well, the reason is I noticed that people drink anyway, you know,  Sure-- They don't really um like in high schools and stuff. If if theoretically, we were to to lower it, I felt like it wasn't really change anything.

Well, I don't think that's true.  Yeah-- I-I, it's partially true, but I don't think that's like, that statement could be generalized for the entire population of college students.  I guess the reason maybe that I feel like, perhaps this is not the right approach is if you if the intention on maybe having a higher drinking age is to prevent um, you know, reckless behavior, or, I don't know, reckless behavior among teenagers when they drink. I feel like maybe a more um effective approach would be like to educate… do more education about how to drink safely rather than imposing it-- Yeah, definitely --As a law, um so, yeah, Alright we're almost there.

Like I know a lot of people who like don't do it just because it's the law too,  So like if the law isn't there like like like whether people who are religious or whether people who are like, I don't we just don't we just like, we don't want to like, like I don't know, how do you say this? Like, go against the law or something? But like, if you lower it, like, like how much lower would you want it to be like 19? Like, like, uhh-- I just feel like-- --People have that like conception of like, oh, if you're in college you're gonna drink? Well, I don't think that's true.  I-I, it's partially true, but I don't think that's like, that statement could be generalized for the entire population of college students.  Yeah, definitely Alright we're almost there.  Yeah, cuz like I'm from China and um, I went back like with my family a few years ago. And like I was of age in China. "
7,NB,"Okay, um, so I put a four. I like very minorly disagree um because ok.. I definitely get annoyed when, like, parents just like sit down their kid and they're like, here look at the-- look the iPad. Um because like...yeah, I mean, I'm sure... yeah, you know..Um but I think sometimes they can be really helpful like if they if it helps them, like, focus on like an educational program that like maybe helps them like, learn math to--. Like yeah, get better or like have um, I don't know, have like a head start before starting school. Um or like maybe the parents aren't very available because they have really tight work schedules. Or like, are in a working class family and they just like need to, like have this way of teaching their kid something. Um I don't think it's ideal, but I think it can help in certain circumstances. I disagree.  Okay-- I put I put a 10 for this.  Okay-- Yea-- And I think also, such early iPad use early really just encourages that idea of like these things are normalized and should be in major part of life which really they shouldn't and they should only be a tool rather than, like a, an attachment means to achieving things. So then yea, I disagree with that.  Yeah, I agree with those points. But I think like, some people, like don't have the resources to, like, be there all the time with their kids, or like, um they're just like in a really bad situation. Or um like they, they can't really hire someone because it's really expensive. Um and like, I think if there is a solution then like that, could be one, ok, like, really developed apps or something, that like know childhood development um that could help especially if the parents are not educated in like early childhood development, which many are not--they're like not prepared in that way. So, I think that could potentially work.  Yea-- I do see your point-- I think you're missing a point because still it would be really bad for their health, their eyesight and--","I disagree.

8,TYB,"No. Yeah, that makes sense. And I, yeah, I appreciate that sentiment. I think, I think where I'm coming from is like, I've always done it. And so, and like, I guess I'm also coming from the same standpoint of like, it's always worked and like, um and I also think herd immunity is something that I know a little bit about, like, not as much as I should, obviously, but um.. What do you know about herd immunity? I mean, just like, what like, I don't know the exact number but like 80% of people need to have it in order for the immunizations to actually take its full effect. And so because of that, it just made sense. However, I do know that like seasonal flus are like, changes so rapidly as I... Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, like... Anyway.. haha. Yeah, um, yeah, I think that's really important cause like individual responsibility, right? Yeah, I guess. For me I was thinking like it wouldn't hurt some make it required...  Yeah. Um but also, I do think that, yeah, just like you said, just like freedom of what you do with your body.  Mm-hm. Ya, uh-uh that makes sense... um Huhh I'm stressed to start something else haha..

9,TYB,"Oh, I think I strongly disagreed. Did you strongly agree? I agreed, yeah.  Yeah. I definitely get what you're saying. I appreciate what you're saying about, like students who have a limited amount of time. And I definitely think that is the case. But I think like, there are a lot of different forms of volunteering that students can like participate in and I think it's kind of a way to like get some some hands on experience like I know that, um, for a lot of students like a a mandatory volunteering is like one of the only ways they can really get involved in their community because a lot of a lot like I know a lot of people here don't engage in engage like the Hyde Park community all that much. I think it's important to not have like the University so isolated from the area around it. Yeah, so I feel like we both agree it would be good for volunteers... Yeah.  ...I just like, like, for example, like how would you even want to enfor-,  like my question's like how are we even going to enforce this right. Like, like how would you prove that like I volunteered at like something. Like like I I just don't see how this could be feasible to enforce. Yeah, that's a good point. I think it would be half... Like I feel like I could lie about this very easily.. haha.. Haha.. Yeah. I think you'd have to, um, have the school organize it to some degree. Um, but I think yeah, you're right that I would I think once the school starts to organize it, it would probably get more complicated. I think you're right that like, in theory, it's a good idea. But in practice, it would be more difficult, but I think like, even if it doesn't work out perfectly, it would still be better to have like, a a majority of students like actually volunteering rather than like the students who are willing to, like try to find a way to get around the system. I feel like that would be a smaller proportion of students that like would actually just... Okay, so like so they're always going to be like bad actors in the community, but like, just like, yeah, putting a requirement, well, is like, encourage people to volunteer, is sort of what you're saying. Yeah, Yeah, I think like, um ya.. I feel like that's fairly reasonable... I think like most people, like probably wouldn't actively volunteer and you said like, do you want to do this, but if they had a requirement to, I feel like most people would it be so strongly opposed to it that they'd like find a way to get out of it. I think most people would just like go along. Hmm. Okay. Well, seems like we're out of time. Okay, cool conversation.","I agreed, yeah.  Yeah. I definitely get what you're saying.

10,TYB,"So I'm from a culture where, like a country where capital punishment, like people are used to capit- uh uh, capti- punis- ... capital punishment. So I guess I'm just kind of used to the fact that it is something that we can do. So I appreciate that you bring up that there are like different perspectives, especially by country (in specific?). I think when I was answering the question, this is something that comes up a lot in like elementary school education as a debate topic. And when we do, like, basic preliminary research on it, a lot of what we saw was that it's not always successful. And so there are a lot of attempts that sometimes have to be made, which turns out to be an expensive process. Well that was one of the main reasons I I answered the way I did. Yea.. I kind of agree with what you said that they were just like use things (then set data?) to (prove?) that whether capital punishment, um, should be abolished. But I think, um, could you elaborate more on the research that you mentioned. Yeah, so, um, thank you for asking. And I'd like to clarify first that this is something I haven't seen, like, this is a question I haven't answered since maybe sixth grade. But, um, well and the projects that we did way back when, uh, it was I think we were mostly looking at single interaction. As one that wasn't always successful. It had like a 93% success rate or something. And so that 7% of the time, we were looking at it in terms of it being, like I said, an expensive process that required like the entire procedure of bringing in additional people to officiate it and also that, um, could ultimately be cruel to the person if it was not successful... I guess, uh, one of the reasons that I would agree not to abolish capital punishment is because, um, people would be emotionally satisfied with the result if the people who committed the crime is punished in a way.. like, it's like an eye for an eye. So if someone kills another person, then maybe it should like this person actually deserve the same punishment. Yeah. Thanks for bringing that up. I really hadn't looked at it that way before in terms of the family, or whoever it was feeling a sense of, uh, I guess closure...","So I appreciate that you bring up that there are like different perspectives, especially by country (in specific?).
