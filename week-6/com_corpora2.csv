Um, yeah. Um I guess I'd like to hear you talk about it I actually didn't ook much into the legal system here, but for death penalty, I think like, if..I think if someone committed to a really serious crime such as umm very like, like murdering people and like not being regretful about that and then um like continuously doing a lot of things that will harm the security of the society and also the people around them. I don't think there is any reason why this person could continue to live in this society, Yeah, like definitely, like, I definitely see what you mean what the reason I personally am against the death penalty isn't because I don't think some people should be from removed society because if you have like someone who's like, I don't know, like a terrorist who, who knows people indiscriminately or something like that, you know, I think they should be removed from society, but at the same time, you know, in terms of like implementation a lot of the time. So like, in the US, like, when someone is sentenced to death, like, the, just from, like, there's, I guess there's two perspectives, there's like, the sort of pragmatic perspective and then there's, like a moral perspective, like, and just from, like, the pragmatic perspective, you know, like when you're talking about like, like, I've done a little bit of research into this. Uh like, it actually costs more to send it to like, uhh an execution because there's a ton of like checks to make sure that you're not executing the wrong person like  even even in spite of that every once in a while, you know, like people after their execution are exonerated by DNA evidence and you know, you can't undo a death sentence but you can undo a Life Sentence  I see what you mean.  And then the other thing is like from like a more like moral perspective or not not even a moral perspective. But like, I remember I, I haven't actually read the study. But I remember reading that there was a study that said that like the death penalty isn't any worse than like a life sentence, like life without parole when it comes to punishing or when it comes to discouraging crime. And like when it comes to um what is it? And then like some people, like, from certain points of view, you know, a life sentence without parole might even be a worse punishment than a death sentence. Because with the death sentence, you know, you're you're dying, like you don't have to stew in prison and think about what you've done, you know? With the life sentence, you know, you're left to live the rest of your life, you know, thinking about what to did if that makes sense?  But I guess that, um I don't know.

5,NB,12,7,"Yea, so so so. What do you--what do you personally think about this? I think the US, I answered that the US should lower it. Um not too strongly but just moderately I agree with the statement is because um..I'm so I'm from Korea and drinking age  in Korea is 19. And so I was.. I guess I was shocked when I came to the US. I thought it was 21.  OK-- And I-I well, the reason is I noticed that people drink anyway, you know,  Sure-- They don't really um like in high schools and stuff. If if theoretically, we were to to lower it, I felt like it wasn't really change anything. Mhmm So I think that's why I moderately agreed with this statement [laughs] Personally I thought that like, although like we're on a college campus, like um drinking it very like it's like what like what you said drinking is very um, like we think it's like happening a lot right? Because it's like, just like fraternities and sororities that  have events where it's people like, like drink right? But like, I-I think like, like, like that's not necessarily true because like I still like me personally.

Like, go against the law or something? But like, if you lower it, like, like how much lower would you want it to be like 19?

Well, I don't think that's true. I-I, it's partially true, but I don't think that's like, that statement could be generalized for the entire populationof college students.  I guess the reason maybe that I feel like, perhaps this is not the right approach is if you if the intention on maybe having a higher drinking age is to prevent um, you know, reckless behavior, or, I don't know, reckless behavior among teenagers when they drink. I feel like my a more um effective approach would be like to educate.

Um not too strongly but just moderately I agree with the statement is because um..I'm so I'm from Korea and drinking age  in Korea is 19. And so I was.. I guess I was shocked when I came to the US. I thought it was 21.  And I-I well, the reason is I noticed that people drink anyway, you know,  They don't really um like in high schools and stuff. If if theoretically, we were to to lower it, I felt like it wasn't really change anything. So I think that's why I moderately agreed with this statement [laughs] Yea-- Sure, like 19 could be fine I guess..and I-I- get, I unders--ike, Yeah-- I guess the reason maybe that I feel like, perhaps this is not the right approach is if you if the intention on maybe having a higher drinking age is to prevent um, you know, reckless behavior, or, I don't know, reckless behavior among teenagers when they drink. I feel like my a more um effective approach would be like to educate. Do more education about how to drink safely rather than imposing it-- --As a law, um so, yeah, Yeah, it works. I mean,  Yeah.  mhm"

So I don't think that they'll be responsible for their actions.

11,NB,18,12,"Umm okay, so I said Ivy schools should be.. I completely disagree with this statement because I think umm there's a lot of inequality in the world. And I think that a lot of things like test scores and um recommendations [person A: mhm].. are there's a lot of privilege inherent in like test scores. Um I know people who are able to pay for test prep [person A: mhm] and they're like the class is like $300 [person A: mhm] so there's a lot of inequality disparity for test prep [person A: mhm]. And so if you just base things off of like scores or who has access to teachers, who will write them recommendations [person A: mhm], or um just a lot of factors that are paying for application factors like that are like hindrances to um to the application process and to help stronger an application may look [person A: mhm]. And so I think that if you don't account for privilege, the most privileged people will look better in your eyes [person A: mhm]. And then so if you don't account for race, you might end up with a campus of all white privileged people. Ohhh, okay, well, at first, I was going to agree, but after hearing what you said, it does make sense. Umm-- [laughs] Let me think about this--at first, I was going to agree with it.

Yeah, but then when when hearing about like, how if you say like, if we don't, then we might have like a school full of like a certain amount of race [person B: mhm]. Like it also makes sense why we why they shouldn't be completely blind to us. So now I'm at like a 50/50 [laughs]. And like this is not to say that like, only white students are like the best students [person A: mhm] .  I think diversity is like, for a lot of schools an important aspect [person A: mhm] . You can't like make diversity  a goal if you don't account for it. [person A: mhm]  So and I mean, I mean it does, like suck, that that's where our society is at, but we have to be proactive with like, the issues that we have [person B: mhm]. So and there's no such thing as like, the blind.  Yeah-- To race, like what if they write about race and ethnicity and their um like essays-- --true--  --there's no, there's no such thing as like being blind to a canidate's race--or if their name, like you know how names are //--  --that's also-- --yeah you can kind of tell by the last name as well.

Like it also makes sense why we why they shouldn't be completely blind to us. So now I'm at like a 50/50 [laughs]. Yeah-- --true-- --that's also-- --yeah you can kind of tell by the last name as well. Yeah","Umm okay, so I said Ivy schools should be.. I completely disagree with this statement because I think umm there's a lot of inequality in the world. And I think that a lot of things like test scores and um recommendations [person A: mhm].. are there's a lot of privilege inherent in like test scores. Um I know people who are able to pay for test prep [person A: mhm] and they're like the class is like $300 [person A: mhm] so there's a lot of inequality disparity for test prep [person A: mhm]. And so if you just base things off of like scores or who has access to teachers, who will write them recommendations [person A: mhm], or um just a lot of factors that are paying for application factors like that are like hindrances to um to the application process and to help stronger an application may look [person A: mhm]. And so I think that if you don't account for privilege, the most privileged people will look better in your eyes [person A: mhm]. And then so if you don't account for race, you might end up with a campus of all white privileged people. And like this is not to say that like, only white students are like the best students [person A: mhm] .  I think diversity is like, for a lot of schools an important aspect [person A: mhm] . You can't like make diversity  a goal if you don't account for it. [person A: mhm]  So and I mean, I mean it does, like suck, that that's where our society is at, but we have to be proactive with like, the issues that we have [person B: mhm]. So and there's no such thing as like, the blind.  To race, like what if they write about race and ethnicity and their um like essays--  --there's no, there's no such thing as like being blind to a canidate's race--or if their name, like you know how names are //--  So there's like really no such thing.

12,NB,19,12,"Awesome. Well-- Okay--  I think I remember saying that um teenagers should have a lock on their bedroom doors or should be allowed to have a lock on the bedroom doors.

13,TYB,20,6," Okay, cool. Do you remember what you said for it? I think I said like slightly disagree or something? Okay, I said like an eight or something. Um I don't know why why did you put what you put? Like sometimes it just wanted something that's not that healthy or something like that, but-- --Yeah-- --I think just high school should have the option to-- --Yeah-- --be able to offer that. But as I said, I do kind of think that you know, most food that high schools offer should be healthy. It's just not a flexibility sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah, I guess like the sticking point there is like the only right? Yeah Yeah, I don't know. I'm a high school student right now. So I sometimes wish like, my high school only offered healthy food because I think for me, like it would be easier to make choices if all the choices healthy choices.  Yeah that's true. And I feel like I make a lot of choices like during the day. That sounds so like whiny, like I want to make less choices but like sometimes it'd be nice to like--  --Yeah-- --I wouldn't have to always like choose to not eat unhealthy food you know what I mean?  Yea, that's pretty fair. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, that kind of like that they don't they don't give you a choice then you have no choice what so ever--  Exactly, right? Yeah, or it's like the whole like stupid like Steve Jobs thing where he's like, you should only you should like dress in the same thing every day.  Yeah, yeah. So you have like less choices to make sometimes I wish like healthy eating could be like that. Like it'd be so much easier if you didn't have to worry-- --Yeah-- --about that.

Yeah,  so it might be harder  to offer like low income uh--  --students-- --student lunches-- Yeah, yeah, I guess also the question is like, what is like, like, how do we define healthy, you know? I don't know. Yeah, that's hard [laughs]  People define healthy in like def-- in like really different ways. Yeah, it's like, certain meals can be healthy or not depending on like-- --Yeah, like what you're-- --Your own medical conditions -- --Yeah, exactly-- --Like your overall diet-- Yeah, that's a really good point.

14,NB,21,6," Okay, so I believe I was against this, that must mean that you-- I like I just totally think it takes you out of the situation and therefore-- Oh, I thought I was also--should never be allowed to text on their phones. I misread the question actually-- Oh, yeah, no--I actually really significantly. I feel that people should be able to text on their phones at any meal. I don't have any problem.  Okay, okay.  So I did miss-read, yeah, I my stance on it is if someone is over using their technology, that's a very different thing.

It feels like it's reducing, I guess-- Sorry, say that again-- Like, it feels like if we can't use our phones in those situations, you're sort of making it so that there's less interaction with your friends and family.

So, I believe that they should be blind only because of these heuristics that we have in our minds that like, while we don't want them to be playing a part in a lot of these decisions, these heuristics, unfortunately, are just what we have instinctually. And so inherently, those create biases, which those biases might play, in favor or against, depending on that person's specific background. Well, I disagree with what you're saying, because I think that these biases that you're talking about could be beneficial in terms of like helping people who have… had access to less resources on their way to college, for example, like, typically, like minority groups have, are in worse economical situations. And then you like the white person, your typical white person. So, I think I think affirmative action is a positive thing because even though like, if- if Ivy League schools were completely blind to a candidate, like race and ethnicity, then there would be a bias anyway, because people with like, people not in the minorities would have an advantage over people and minorities. No, that's just that's really interesting because I have the same reasoning but the opposite.  So it’s just that like, if they see that they might make assumptions, but I mean I agree with what you're saying. I agree with everything you just said.

That's my stance, I... I don't know either. . here's the problem, so I guess, um, since this is a good point that, hmm, I don't really know what is ethical or not, , um, when I buy things. hmm. I probably should try to know what they..  yes, that is a good point. Yeah, that's a good point. I guess that's true. hmm. It's like we buy a lot of things that are not made ethically , anyway like we don't like iPhones and iPads are not made / right. . hmm, so, and it's hard to switch and find alternatives , because work is well. hmm. So I'm glad you brought that up, but you know.. Yeah, so like they'll use like, snails is like replacements for whips or something. or stuff like that.  .. put it on the snail. Like no, like on the snails' skin. Yeah.  Yeah. It's like some of us is pretty bad.  I don't know I that's just like what one that I've heard of. hmm.  So I don't even know like what they do. But I know they do do animal testing. It's not.. um.. / Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess that's a good point is that most people don't really know.  Yeah, as hard to do research and not have to switch the whole thing. hmm. Yeah, that's true.

Did they use are all animals?  wait..How? {{}}  and he would happen? I don't understand how that even translate into  Oh. Yeah, I don't know. I didn't.. and I actually {{}} no.

Okay, so you guys are gonna have a three minute conversation on a topic that you guys disagree the most on based on the survey you guys took when you rate your responses from 0 to 10. So, so for that response for this prompt two: ""People should avoid walking across the street against a red light. Even if there are no cars in sight."" You ranked it as a seven and you ranked it as a two. Does that sound right? Okay, so, I'm gonna leave this here. So you guys will have a three minute conversation in which you discuss this prompt and why you answered the question the way you did. We're going to have you begin, if you don't mind. Um, I'm gonna set the timer for three minutes and when it goes off we should hear it but if not, feel free to come and grab us. So you can start and then go back and forth.  Okay, sounds good. Hi.  Hi, Um, so I ranked that pretty low just because I don't think jay-walking really is.. um, a bad thing. I think in actuality like people tend to be pretty good judges of like when they should cross the street and when they shouldn't.. Mm-hm. ..um there can be actually more accidents at crosswalks.. Mm-hm.  ..um, because people are following the signs and they're not looking at the cars, they are following the signs, and the cars may be going or not stopping and then they get hit. Ya. So I think generally like jaywalking is pretty harmless and people are pretty good at assesing danger for themselves. Gotcha. Okay, cool. That's a really good point. Thank you for bringing that one up. I I agree that and I'm I'm in the similar boat have been many times and I figured I was a good enough judge that I would cross the street as well. This is actually a tough conversation for me. I'm spending most of my time in England right now. And, uh, there's different rules in England. Oh really? Than in the US. Yeah, yeah. In England, you can cross so as long as no one's around,  and so, so that's kind of why I put in some actually. And if not from the US, I would have put it higher and the only reason why is more just.. two reasons, I guess. One, just the way I was brought up, I was kind of brought up, just follow the rules of the road, you know, even if it's something that I don't necessarily agree with, just something that I should do if it's required of me by those who are in authority. Oh wow! Cool Mm-hm.  So kind of just like a respect for authority thing. Um, but then also, look at a lot of the people that got hit and hurt while jaywalking. Probably a lot of them would have thought that they were good judges of when they should cross too. So there's just seems, some sort of a lot of uncertainty to letting people decide for themselves when is a good time to do certain things, and not certain things. So I mean, I think that's fair. I don't know. [laugh] Ya [laughs] [inaudible talking while laughing] [laughs] Well, I appreciate I appreciate that you, uh, that you thought about it and that you are.. uh that you know that its... Ya ...an interesting thing. Yeah.  Yeah,  I think it's it's tough because in a lot of situation I hate waiting.  Yeah.  So so it for me, it's usually a battle between some sort of moral feeling that I have. And then frustration. And.. yeah  sometimes I win morality over frustration, but sometimes frustration wins over. [laughs]  [laughs] Yeah, that's true. Yeah, definitely  Yeah. Also like, I guess my thought was like, also it tends to be like even when there's no cars in sight versus like, I think it's kind of a different position when there's like, oncoming, like .. Ohh ..you see a car coming from the distance. Like.. That's true.. ..I feel like in that situation weights a little bit differently than when if like you see no cars.  Ok.. Well, yeah. I don't know [laughs] No ya, I like that. That's a really good point.. So So what you're saying is there could be some sort of a rule  ..where, if you can see a car coming along, um I think it's really important. One question I have then is, like, one of the issues that might come up with some court cases would you be able to separate Yeah...  Yeah, right like how do you tell?  ..so there were no cars in sight...","Okay, sounds good. Hi.  Mm-hm. Mm-hm.  Ya. Gotcha. Okay, cool. That's a really good point. Thank you for bringing that one up. I I agree that and I'm I'm in the similar boat have been many times and I figured I was a good enough judge that I would cross the street as well. This is actually a tough conversation for me. I'm spending most of my time in England right now. And, uh, there's different rules in England. Than in the US. Yeah, yeah. In England, you can cross so as long as no one's around,  and so, so that's kind of why I put in some actually. And if not from the US, I would have put it higher and the only reason why is more just.. two reasons, I guess. One, just the way I was brought up, I was kind of brought up, just follow the rules of the road, you know, even if it's something that I don't necessarily agree with, just something that I should do if it's required of me by those who are in authority. So kind of just like a respect for authority thing. Um, but then also, look at a lot of the people that got hit and hurt while jaywalking. Probably a lot of them would have thought that they were good judges of when they should cross too. So there's just seems, some sort of a lot of uncertainty to letting people decide for themselves when is a good time to do certain things, and not certain things. So Ya [laughs] [laughs] Well, I appreciate I appreciate that you, uh, that you thought about it and that you are.. uh that you know that its... ...an interesting thing. Yeah.  I think it's it's tough because in a lot of situation I hate waiting.  So so it for me, it's usually a battle between some sort of moral feeling that I have. And then frustration.

One question I have then is, like, one of the issues that might come up with some court cases would you be able to separate ..so there were no cars in sight...","Experimenter  0:00   This is group number 60 discussing topic number two. Okay, so you guys are gonna have a three minute conversation on a topic that you guys disagree the most on based on the survey you guys took when you rate your responses from 0 to 10. So, so for that response for this prompt two: ""People should avoid walking across the street against a red light. Even if there are no cars in sight."" You ranked it as a seven and you ranked it as a two. Does that sound right? Okay, so, I'm gonna leave this here. So you guys will have a three minute conversation in which you discuss this prompt and why you answered the question the way you did. We're going to have you begin, if you don't mind. Um, I'm gonna set the timer for three minutes and when it goes off we should hear it but if not, feel free to come and grab us. So you can start and then go back and forth.  Hi, Um, so I ranked that pretty low just because I don't think jay-walking really is.. um, a bad thing. I think in actuality like people tend to be pretty good judges of like when they should cross the street and when they shouldn't.. ..um there can be actually more accidents at crosswalks.. ..um, because people are following the signs and they're not looking at the cars, they are following the signs, and the cars may be going or not stopping and then they get hit. So I think generally like jaywalking is pretty harmless and people are pretty good at assesing danger for themselves. Oh really? Oh wow! Cool Mm-hm.  I mean, I think that's fair. I don't know. [laugh] [inaudible talking while laughing] Ya Yeah,  Yeah.  yeah   [laughs] Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Also like, I guess my thought was like, also it tends to be like even when there's no cars in sight versus like, I think it's kind of a different position when there's like, oncoming, like .. ..you see a car coming from the distance. Like.. ..I feel like in that situation weights a little bit differently than when if like you see no cars.  Well, yeah. I don't know [laughs] Yeah...  Yeah, right like how do you tell? "
